	 		<p> <center><br> Hi, my name is Colleen! I am currently a senior in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I am specializing in Information Analysis within the School of Information because I am very interested in big data and analysis. Outside of the classroom I am a part of the lagest student organization, Dance Marathon. I joined Dance Marathon as a freshman because I have a passion for working with kids and advocating for those of all different abilities. The last two years I decided to take on a leadership position on the Information Management team so that I could give back to the organization that has given me so much. Joining this organization has been the most rewarding experience of my college career. I am always inspired by such hardworking, dedicated, and passionate people. <br>
